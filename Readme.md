# Leetcode Problem Solving

I'll approach to solve leetcode problems using JavaScript, C# and PHP.
Starting with the easy ones, then gradually approach hard ones.

I'll try to avoid library functions. Which may cause some performence bottlenecks. But hey, all i'm doing here is for practiece, there might be better soulution & I'll always appreciate that.
